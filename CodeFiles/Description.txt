Topic: AI _ implementing logistic regression for labeling diabets. 

Steps:

- Cleaning data:
    Replacing invalid records with means of each features (Zero values)
    features: Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, and BMI 

- Training: 
    Initialize weights as zero ===>  (w1, w2, ... , wn)
    Initialize bias as zero ===> (b) or (theta_0)

- Given a data point:
    Predict result by using y = 1 / (1 + e^(-wx + b)) ===> (sigmoid function)
    Calculate error ===> (error = y - y_hat)   
    Use gradient descent to update weights and bias ===> (w1 = w1 + x1 * error * learning_rate) and (b = b + error * learning_rate)
    Repeat n times (n_iters)

- Testing:
    Given a data point:
    Put the values into the sigmoid function ===> (y_hat)
    Choose the label based on the value of y_hat ===> (y_hat > 0.5, y_hat = 1) or (y_hat < 0.5, y_hat = 0)

- Main:
    Here we have a tiny interface with three options:
    1. Accuracy of our logistic regression
    2. Predict if one person has diabets or not
    3. Exit (note that if you exit the progarm you have to wait for the AI to be trained again for next use)

Data:
# Total data: 2728
# Train data: 2728 * 0.70 ~= 1909
# Test data: 819
